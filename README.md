# engg233-final-project

Final project for a first-year computer science course. An application made using the Processing IDE that visually represents temperature data in Calgary from the past 30 years (max/min/snowfall). Allows the user to visualize data through a bar chart or scatter plot, as well as adjust which data is shown on screen.
